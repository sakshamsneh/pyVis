# MY PLANS
## Plan 1:
1. Clean the dataset(only tweet, user, date and time)
2. For each unique user:
    1. Find their last 50 tweets
    2. Classify them into 3 sentiments
    3. Get the overall sentiment of user:
	  4. `Define the user as a node, size as the sentiment`
3. For each tweet:
	`find the tweet's sentiment`
4. For all db:
  `find count of each unique users`

## Plan 2:
1. Get the trending hashtag of any given day
2. Same as [Plan 1](#plan-1)

## Plan 3:
`Word cloud of a user, interactive as time-series, allowing user to view the changes in the posts made over a given time period.`
